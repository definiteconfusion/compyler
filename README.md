Transpiler to functionally / logically convert Python to Rust. Still in early development, but its still kind of a neat toy for now

  - `For`

- Conditionals

  - `if`
  - `elif`

- Boolean Operations

  - `==`
  - `!=`
  - `>`
  - `<`
  - `>=`

  - `-=`
  - `*`
  - `/`
  - `//`
  - `%`

- Builtin Functions

- Variables (currently all variables are initiated as `mut`, this will change later, I'm just lazy and don't wanna write a watcher at the moment.)
